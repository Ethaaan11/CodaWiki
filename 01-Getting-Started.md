Embarking on your Coda journey is straightforward.  
Just follow these steps:

1. **Install Coda Interpreter**: Begin by installing the Coda interpreter on your system.
    Clone the repository and build the interpreter for your system.

2. **Write Your Code**: Craft your Coda code in a plain text file, ensuring you use the `.coda` extension.

3. **Execute Your Code**: Launch the Coda interpreter, providing the path to your Coda file as an argument. For example, if your Coda file is named `hello.coda`, run the interpreter using the following command:

    ```
    Coda hello.coda
    ```

    OR

    ```
    Coda.exe hello.coda
    ```

By following these simple steps, you'll be well on your way to harnessing the power of Coda for your programming endeavors.
