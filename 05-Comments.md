## Introduction:

In Coda, comments are non-executable text that you can include in your code to provide explanations, documentation, or notes to yourself and other developers. Comments are not executed by the Coda interpreter and have no impact on the functionality of the code. They are solely meant to improve code readability and maintainability.

## Types of Comments:
In Coda programming, comments are essential for enhancing code readability and conveying information to other developers. There are various ways to annotate your code using comments, and two distinct types are full-line comments and partial-line comments. Each type serves a specific purpose in code documentation and explanation.

### 1. Full-Line Comments:

Full-line comments are a type of comment where the entire line is treated as a comment and ignored by the Coda interpreter. These comments are particularly useful for adding explanations, notes, or temporarily disabling lines of code without affecting the program's functionality.

Example of a full-line comment:
```javascript
// This line initializes the variable 'count' to keep track of the number of items.
var count = 0;
```

In this example, the entire line is a comment, and the variable `count` is not initialized or modified in any way. Full-line comments are commonly used for providing context or explanations for individual lines of code or blocks of code.

### 2. Partial-Line Comments:

Partial-line comments, sometimes referred to as inline comments, are comments that appear within a line of code. These comments are used to explain specific parts of a line or to annotate specific actions or decisions.

Example of a partial-line comment:
```asm
var total = price * quantity; // Calculate the total cost
// OR
// Calculate the total cost; var total = price * quality

// Both code pieces works the same.
```

In this example, the comment explains the purpose of the calculation and provides additional context. However, only the part between `//` and the end of the line is treated as a comment. The calculation itself is executed by the interpreter.

> It's worth noting that the description of partial-line comments provided, involving `\\` and `;`, is not a standard way of indicating partial-line comments in Programming, it is unique to Coda. By this method you can add a comment before the executable line of code.


## Purpose of Comments:
1. **Code Documentation:** Comments help other developers (including your future self) understand the purpose and functionality of specific code segments.

2. **Explanation:** Comments can explain complex logic, algorithms, or decisions made in the code, making it easier for others to comprehend.

3. **Debugging:** Comments can be used to temporarily disable lines of code for debugging purposes without actually removing them.

4. **Todo Notes:** Developers often use comments to mark tasks that need to be completed in the future. For example, `// TODO: Implement error handling here`.

## Best Practices:

1. **Be Concise:** Write clear and concise comments that provide valuable information without being overly verbose.

2. **Maintain Consistency:** Follow consistent formatting and commenting practices throughout your codebase.

3. **Update Comments:** Keep comments up to date as the code evolves. Outdated comments can be misleading.

4. **Avoid Redundancy:** Comment only when necessary. Code should be self-explanatory whenever possible.

## Conclusion:

Comments in Coda play a crucial role in improving code quality, collaboration among developers, and overall maintainability. By using appropriate comments, you can enhance the understanding of your code and make it easier for others to contribute to and maintain the project. Remember to use comments judiciously and follow best practices to ensure your code remains clear and understandable.
