In the Coda programming language, we empower developers with the capability to employ conditional statements, enabling intelligent decision-making and dynamic code execution based on various conditions. This section illustrates the concept of conditional statements in Coda using an example scenario:

### Example: User Authentication

Consider a user authentication system where we determine access levels based on user roles. The Coda code snippet below demonstrates how conditional statements can be applied to handle this scenario:

```js
let userRole = "admin";
let accessLevel;

if (userRole == "admin") {
    accessLevel = "Full access rights granted.";
} elif (userRole == "user") {
    accessLevel = "Limited access rights granted.";
} else {
    accessLevel = "Unauthorized access.";
}

println("User Role: " + userRole);
println("Access Level: " + accessLevel);
```

```bash
# Output
User Role: admin
Access Level: Full access rights granted.

```

In this example:

- If the user's role is "admin", they are granted full access rights.
- If the user's role is "user", they receive limited access rights.
- For any other role, the user is denied access.

### Advantages of Conditional Statements in Coda:

- **Smart Decision-Making:** Coda's conditional statements empower us to make intelligent decisions in our code, enhancing user experiences and program functionality.
- **Flexible Logic:** By combining conditions using logical operators such as `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `&&` (AND), and `||` (OR), we can craft sophisticated logic tailored to our requirements.
- **Readable Syntax:** The use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords in Coda ensures code remains comprehensible and maintainable.

### Conclusion
 Conditional statements in Coda, much like in other programming languages, are a powerful tool for enabling intelligent decision-making in our code. They allow us to create dynamic applications that respond to various scenarios and user inputs. By using keywords like ```if```, ```elif (else if)```, and ```else```, we can craft logic that enhances user experiences and program functionality. The ability to combine conditions using logical operators makes our code flexible, while maintaining readability and maintainability. Overall, conditional statements in Coda empower developers to create responsive and intelligent applications.
