 Coda, which is a special type of computer tool, you can do something cool. Imagine you're a chef, and you want to give discounts to your customers based on how much they spend. Coda lets you do that easily with the help of conditional statements. When a customer tells you how much they spent, you can use Coda to make a decision. According to the money spent by customers you check conditions(using conditional statements) according to which you give discounts to the customers.

### Example: User Authentication

Consider a user authentication system where we determine access levels based on user roles. The Coda code snippet below demonstrates how conditional statements can be applied to handle this scenario:

```js
let userRole = "admin";
let accessLevel;

if (userRole == "admin") {
    accessLevel = "Full access rights granted.";
} elif (userRole == "user") {
    accessLevel = "Limited access rights granted.";
} else {
    accessLevel = "Unauthorized access.";
}

println("User Role: " + userRole);
println("Access Level: " + accessLevel);
```

```bash
# Output
User Role: admin
Access Level: Full access rights granted.

```

In this example:

- If the user's role is "admin", they are granted full access rights.
- If the user's role is "user", they receive limited access rights.
- For any other role, the user is denied access.

### Advantages of Conditional Statements in Coda:

- **Smart Decision-Making:** Coda's conditional statements empower us to make intelligent decisions in our code, enhancing user experiences and program functionality.
- **Flexible Logic:** We can create complex logic in our code by using special words like ```==```, which means ```equals``` ,```!=``` for ```not equals```, ```&&``` for ```AND```, and ```||``` for ```OR``` 
   These words help us make decisions in a more detailed way, exactly as we need them.

  For example, if we want to check if a person is both over 18 years old (using ```&&``` to mean ```AND```) and has a driver's license, we can use these operators. This means the person must meet both conditions 
  to proceed.

  On the other hand, if we only need one of two conditions to be true, like being a student OR being a senior citizen to get a discount, we use ```||``` (meaning ```OR```).

  So, by using these words, we can create customized rules and conditions in our code to make it do exactly what we want, making our programs smart and flexible.
- **Readable Syntax:** The use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords in Coda ensures code remains comprehensible and maintainable.

### Conclusion
 Conditional statements in Coda, much like in other programming languages, are a powerful tool for enabling intelligent decision-making in our code. They allow us to create dynamic applications that respond to various scenarios and user inputs. By using keywords like ```if```, ```elif (else if)```, and ```else```, we can craft logic that enhances user experiences and program functionality. The ability to combine conditions using logical operators makes our code flexible, while maintaining readability and maintainability. Overall, conditional statements in Coda empower developers to create responsive and intelligent applications.
