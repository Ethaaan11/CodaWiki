# Arithmetic Operators: Building Blocks of Calculation

Within the world of Coda, arithmetic operators play a fundamental role in shaping your calculations. These operators form the backbone of numerical operations, allowing you to perform essential computations with ease and precision.

## Addition (+)
The `+` operator in Coda brings numbers together, allowing you to add them and obtain their sum.

```coda
let x = 5 + 5
```

## Subtraction (-)
When you need to subtract one number from another, the `-` operator steps in, enabling you to derive the difference.

```coda
let y = 5 - 5
```

## Multiplication (*)
The `*` operator signifies multiplication, offering a straightforward method to multiply numbers and obtain their product.

```coda
let z = 5 * 5
```

## Division (/)
For the task of dividing numbers, the `/` operator takes center stage, granting you the ability to find quotients effortlessly.

## Modulo (%)
When seeking the remainder after division, the `%` operator shines. It helps you capture the leftover value from a division operation.

Strings also find a place within the domain of arithmetic, albeit in a different manner. Coda enables you to concatenate strings using the `+` operator, allowing you to combine textual elements for enhanced communication.

```coda
let x = "Hello, " + "World!"
```

In the realm of Coda, these arithmetic operators act as the building blocks of calculation, offering you the means to manipulate numbers and strings with clarity and efficiency. Through their simplicity and versatility, they empower you to craft algorithms and operations that drive your code forward.
